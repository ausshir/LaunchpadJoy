# LaunchpadJoy
Some hacky python code to take MIDI signal from the Launchpad and register as joystick buttons and lights. It is a bit of a collection of old code and might contain some of other's work.

TO DO: Figure out licensing and credits for any code snippetss used here.

Will need the Vjoy driver in order to run.. and maybe some more stuff?
